fix the draw card mechanic (when I click it my hand disappears)

add player veiwer before load w/ username checker to remove bad chars

animations instead of alerts

delete players on leave

easy rejoin for devtools

winning

sorted hands

put source images in their own folder

stop adding draw element before game accually starts ( too many players )

wild cards (add 'wild' to validColors and change deck generation so we don't end up with something like a wild 4 (will need to change isCard() too))

create a better way to process the '+n' cards so we don't need 20 if statements
